# ✏️ CRUD Operations Web App – Front-End Proof of Concept

This project is a front-end-only web application that demonstrates full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality. Built as a proof-of-concept (PoC), it allows interaction with a local dataset using client-side logic — no backend or database required.

## 🧩 Features

- ➕ **Create**  
  Add new entries to the list through a simple form with input validation.

- 📖 **Read**  
  Display stored data dynamically in a responsive table or card layout.

- ✏️ **Update**  
  Edit existing records with pre-filled form inputs for quick changes.

- ❌ **Delete**  
  Remove items from the dataset with confirmation dialogs for safety.

- 📱 **Responsive Layout**  
  Adapts seamlessly to mobile and desktop using Bootstrap 5.

- ⚙️ **Client-Side Logic**  
  Uses JavaScript and jQuery for real-time DOM manipulation, state updates, and event handling.
